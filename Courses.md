#### Greatest Thing about Golf

One of the greatest thing about golf in my opinion is the golf courses. Being 15 minutes from a city and being is nature is one of the greatest aspects of golfing. Anything that is cool with golf courses is that it is basically turned into art. Having the most elaborate, beatiful courses in the world is a big thing in the golf world. **Five** notable courses includes in no praticualr order inlude:
