### Information about Golf

Golf is the hardest sport that looks the **easiest**. One thing in particular that makes so difficult is that an golf swing is hard to repeat. You could try and replicate it but for some reason *most of the time* it never works. Here is a quote from Ben Hogan, a famous professional golfer, he said
